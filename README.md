# wl-rest-api
## Wizeline REST API for coding bootcamp

### Project description
It's a microservice that exposes 2 endpoints, one for a simple 'Hello, World!' and the other for showing weather information in JSON for 

### Features
 - Written in Python 3.8
 - Powered by Flask
 - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
 - CI includes unit test suite run
 - Continous deployment with Docker image creation and hosting in DockerHub. 
 - The weather endoint consumes the Open Weather API for global weather information. 
 
The reports are serviced via two REST APIs:
|Endpoint| Description |
|--|--|
|[http://localhost:5000â€‹/hello](http://localhost:5000/hello)| Displays a 'Hello, World!' string |
|[http://localhost:5000/weather/{city_name}/](http://localhost:5000/weather/{city_name}/) | Displays a JSON showing weather data for the specified city name |
  
### Prerequisites
 - A recent Docker version installed and running in your box. 

 ### Instructions
 1. Clone the repo. 
 (For your convenience, a Makefile is provided for easy deployment and test of the app.)
 2. `make run-app` . This will download the app image and start a container with it. 
 2.1. In case of problems, make sure your docker daemon is running. 
 2.2. You may also get permission errors, try running with `sudo`.
 3. `make hello-world` 
 4. `make city=<any city name> weather` for displaying any city in the world you like. 
 3. Run `make help` in case you need help. 
 
 ### Troubleshooting
 After deploying, if you test the weather endpoint in your browser, with `curl` or with Postman, if it returns anything other than the JSON data, you may need to append an `/` at the end of the url, e.g. http://localhost:5000/weather/Guadalajara/ instead of http://localhost:5000/weather/Guadalajara
